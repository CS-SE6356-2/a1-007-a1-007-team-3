Game description:
This game is an implementation of the card game Crazy Eights.

Requirements:
Your system must have a Java Runtime Environment installed to run the game. The Java version must be at least Java 8.

How to play the game:
To play the game, you will interact with the game’s graphical interface. Specifically, you will click on cards in your hand to play them. Crazy Eights is similar to another shedding style game called UNO. The objective is to shed all your cards before any of your opponents do. Should you succeed in this regard, you win!

Rules:
You must play a card with the same rank or suit as the previously played card in the discard pile. Alternatively, you may play an eight regardless of the last played card. Eights serve as wild cards.

If you do not have any playable cards, you must draw from the game deck (stock).

You may play one card per turn.

You win if you shed your cards before all other opponents do.

Compilation instructions:
First, make sure you have a Java Development Kit installed. Create a project in Netbeans, a popular Java IDE, and copy all source files into the default package. After that, press the clean and build project button, or press Ctrl + F11.
Following the compilation process, you will find the executable jar file in the dist folder inside the project folder.

Installation instructions:
Simply copy or move the resulting jar file from the compilation instructions above to any location and run it from the command line with the following arguments: java -jar SoftwareEngineeringSemesterProject.jar. Make sure you change the working directory to the directory you copied the game to first.

Alternatively, you may just copy the precompiled jar file and the premade windows batch file we provide to any location you wish. Simply double click the batch file to launch the game.

If you are using MacOS or a Linux distro, you will have to follow the installation instructions at the top of this section.
