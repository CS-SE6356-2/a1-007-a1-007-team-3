This repository contains 3 folders. One contains our client application source code and assets for its graphical user interface, 
another our dedicated server application source code, and the third our compiled executables.

The client application is a full client, so it does not require a connection to a server to work. 
It contains a local offline singleplayer mode against AI players.
